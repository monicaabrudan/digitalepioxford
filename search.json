    "text": "The importance of Digital Epidemiology\n“Digital epidemiology is epidemiology building on digital data and tools” (Salathé M. et al, Life Sci Soc Policy. 2018)\n\nFunded by the NIHR under the Global Health Research Unit programme, our work at the Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance focuses specifically on the applications of digital epidemiology of infectious diseases, including outbreak investigations, pathogen surveillance, understanding of vaccine efficacy and spread of antimicrobial resistance genes and vehicles. \nThe importance of digital epidemiology has been raised to a global level during the pandemic. The value of bringing together genomic with epidemiological and clinical data improved public health decision making, informing experts with regard to virus variants expansions and adding significant contributions to the investigation on the origin of the virus. \nMoreover, the pandemic has taught us that the effective use of digital epidemiology can impact on operational decisions in healthcare settings, impacting on patient wellbeing and outcomes.\nDuring the COVID pandemic there has been a learning curve for many laboratories around the world, who were able to use genomic and digital data to good effect, changing operational approaches and decisions based on results. However, interdisciplinary teams formed of wet-lab scientists, Bioinformaticians, clinicians and non-technical staff (hospital managers, for example) often found barriers in communication of information. The relevance and impact of Digital Epidemiology was often difficult to explain between different professional specialisations. Scientists familiar with Digital Epidemiology often found it challenging to communicate to colleagues what genomic data could and could not reveal. \nThere is a general need to learn how to interpret information related to Digital Epidemiology and to better communicate results to various stakeholders."

By the end of the first two days, the participants will be able to 1) identify relevant internal and external stakeholders, important to their work environment 2) identify areas of weakness and strength in local digital epidemiology 3) Explain how digital epidemiology can be applied in their own country-context 4) Discuss other real-world scenarios of applied digital epidemiology.\n\n\nTargeted competencies and Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes\n\nDigital Epidemiology data tools and workflows\nFlow of data from sample to decision-making\nIntegration of epidemiological, laboratory and genomic data\nIntegrated skills: Communication, Networking, Reporting\n\n\n\nTraining Methods and Instructional Strategies\n\nDiscussions, hands-on activities\n\n\n\nDuration of training\n\nTwo days (14h total)\n\n\n\nResources\nA series of resources will be made available for participants prior, during and after the workshop: tutorials / documentation and printed training materials.\n\n\nRecommended background knowledge\n\nBiological and clinical mechanisms underlying infectious pathogens\nInfectious disease epidemiology and surveillance\nDisease outbreaks\nPathogens of clinical significance\nAntimicrobial resistance"

    "text": "Background\nThe Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance develops free web applications for data collection, integration, visualisation, and analysis of genomic epidemiology data. Epicollect5 is a mobile & web application for free and easy data collection. It provides both the web and mobile applications for the generation of forms (questionnaires) and freely hosted project websites for data collection. Projects are created by using the web application at five.epicollect.net, and then downloaded to the device to perform the data collection. Data are collected in the field using multiple devices and all data can be viewed on a central server (via map, tables, and charts). Data-flo is a system for customised integration and manipulation of diverse data via a simple drag and drop interface. Data-flo provides a visual method to design a reusable pipeline to integrate, clean, and manipulate data in a multitude of ways, eliminating the need for continuous manual intervention (e.g., coding, formatting, spreadsheet formulas, manual copy-pasting). Microreact allows you to upload, visualise and explore any combination of clustering (trees), geographic (map) and temporal (timeline) data. Other metadata variables are displayed in a table. You can specify colours and/or shapes to display on the map, tree and/or timeline. A permanent URL is produced for you to share your Microreact.\n\n\nTargeted competencies and Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes\n\n\nTraining Methods and Instructional Strategies\n\nDiscussions, hands-on activities\n\n\n\nDuration of training\n\nTwo and half days (17h total)\n\n\n\nResources\nA series of resources will be made available for participants prior, during and after the workshop: tutorials / documentation and printed training materials.\n\n\nRecommended background knowledge\n\nBiological and clinical mechanisms underlying infectious pathogens\nInfectious disease epidemiology and surveillance\nDisease outbreaks\nPathogens of clinical significance\nAntimicrobial resistance\nScripting\nExperience with a Linux environment\nKnowledge on next-generation sequencing"
