This three-day course will combine foundational knowledge, practical skills, and expert insights. Day 1 introduces the field with real-world applications and hands-on data analysis and visualisation exercises. Day 2 emphasises implementation strategies, featuring a stakeholder mapping and data architecture workshop and global perspectives from national and continental public health agencies’ experts. The final day focuses on applying these skills to outbreak investigations, culminating in group presentations. Designed for public health professionals, this course offers a blend of theory and practice, equipping participants with the tools to harness digital data for rapid public health responses and decision-making. In the two workshops, attendees will be working in groups, which will provide an opportunity for them to engage in discussions about their progress with fellow participants and to obtain feedback from their peers.\n\n**Intended audience**\n\nOur target audience is composed of epidemiologists, public health experts, public health bioinformaticians, public health microbiologists, health data scientists, and clinicians with an interest in epidemiology and/or data science. Delegates from academic, industry, and other backgrounds are welcome.\n\n**Objectives**\n\nAt the end of the course, participants can expect to be able to explain the relevance of digital epidemiology for rapid public health action, based on real-case scenarios. Additionally, attendees will be able to apply different digital epidemiology tools and implement a data integration and visualisation strategy for surveillance or outbreak investigation. Participants will identify strengths, challenges, and priorities in Digital Epidemiology and generate stakeholder maps all to their specific work context to aid the implementation of digital epidemiology.\n\n**Course coordinators**\n\nMonica Abrudan, Oxford, UK\n\nNatacha Couto, Oxford, UK\n\n**Organisers**\n\n[ESGEM](https://www.escmid.org/esgem/) and The Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance, Pandemic Science Institute, University of Oxford.\n\n**Accreditation**\n\nESCMID Office will apply for accreditation.\n\n**Certification**\n\nCourse organisers will monitor attendance.
